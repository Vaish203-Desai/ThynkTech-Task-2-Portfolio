What is HTML5 (In Simple Words)

HTML5 is the latest standard version of HTML used to structure and present content on the web.
It focuses on semantic structure, multimedia support, performance, accessibility, and cross-device compatibility.

HTML5 – Key Points (Short & Strong)

HTML5 is the latest living standard of HTML, maintained by WHATWG (no HTML6).

It provides semantic elements like <header>, <section>, <footer> which improve SEO, accessibility, and code readability.

Supports responsive design with the viewport meta tag, making websites work across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Built-in multimedia support (<img>, <audio>, <video>) without plugins.

Widely used by Google, Amazon, Netflix, LinkedIn, GitHub, Meta, and all modern web applications.

Forms, accessibility, and performance are improved compared to older HTML versions.

HTML5 is the foundation of modern frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.
